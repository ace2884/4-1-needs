## Usage Scenarios and  Standards of 5G Wireless Communication

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has defined three primary usage scenarios for 5G:

*  **Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB):** Designed to enhance current mobile internet experiences, eMBB targets services requiring high bandwidth, such as HD video streaming, VR, and AR. It aims to support densely populated areas with high traffic demands.
*  **Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (uRLLC):** Focusing on applications requiring ultra-low latency and high reliability, uRLLC targets services such as assisted/automated driving, remote management, and industrial automation.
*  **Massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC):** This scenario addresses services requiring a massive number of connected devices with diverse data rate requirements. It targets applications like smart cities and smart agriculture, where high connection density is crucial.


**5G NR (New Radio):** This air interface, standardized by 3GPP, serves as the foundation for 5G communication. It encompasses both lower frequencies (FR1) below 6 GHz and higher frequencies (FR2) above 24 GHz.

*  **FR1:** Utilizing a maximum channel bandwidth of 100 MHz, FR1 is the more common band for 5G deployments. 
*  **FR2 (mmWave):** Offering channel bandwidths ranging from 50 MHz to 400 MHz, FR2 supports higher data rates but with limited range and penetration.

**Spectrum:** 5G leverages a wide range of radio spectrum, including new allocations and existing bands.

*  **Licensed Spectrum:** Dedicated frequency bands are allocated to operators for exclusive use. Governments and regulatory bodies, like the FCC in the US, manage and auction these bands.
*  **Shared Spectrum:** Operators may share designated frequency bands, allowing for more efficient spectrum utilization.
*  **Unlicensed Spectrum:** Frequencies open for use by anyone, such as the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands used by Wi-Fi.

**Other Standards:** The IEEE 1914 standards focus on the wired infrastructure connecting different components within the RAN. These standards address aspects such as functional splits, data transmission efficiency, and performance requirements for different traffic types.

## Technology of 5G Wireless Communication

**1. New Radio Frequencies:**

5G introduces the use of higher frequencies, particularly in the millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum (**FR2**) above 24 GHz. This allows for much wider bandwidths compared to previous generations, enabling significantly higher data rates. The minimum channel bandwidth defined for **FR2** is 50 MHz, with a maximum of 400 MHz. This contrasts with the more common **FR1** band below 6 GHz, which is limited to a maximum channel bandwidth of 100 MHz due to spectrum scarcity.

The higher frequencies, however, come with limitations. **FR2** signals have shorter range and struggle to penetrate solid objects like walls, trees, and buildings. This necessitates a denser deployment of base stations to ensure coverage, particularly in urban environments.

**2. Advanced Channel Coding:**

To ensure efficient and reliable data transmission, 5G employs advanced channel coding techniques. For data channels, 5G utilizes **LDPC (Low Density Parity Check Codes)**, known for their error correction capabilities. For control channels, 5G employs **Polar codes**, offering efficient encoding and decoding processes. These techniques contribute to improved data transmission efficiency and reliability compared to previous generations.

**3. Operation in Unlicensed Spectrum (NR-U):**

5G NR extends its reach by supporting operation in the unlicensed spectrum, similar to LTE's approach. This allows operators to leverage the vast amount of available spectrum in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, particularly crucial for offloading traffic in congested areas and connecting a massive number of IoT devices.

5G NR supports two modes of operation in unlicensed spectrum:

*   **License Assisted Access (LAA):** Similar to LTE, LAA allows operators to utilize unlicensed spectrum to enhance performance in licensed bands.
*   **Standalone NR-U:** This mode enables the establishment of independent 5G NR networks in unlicensed spectrum, opening possibilities for localized private networks and expanding access to 5G services without requiring a license for a dedicated spectrum.

**4. Massive MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output):**

One of the key technological pillars of 5G is Massive MIMO. This technology employs a significantly larger number of antennas at base stations compared to previous generations, enabling dramatic improvements in spectral efficiency, network capacity, and signal quality.

Massive MIMO allows base stations to simultaneously communicate with multiple users on the same frequency by exploiting the spatial dimension. This increases data throughput and improves signal reliability by using multiple paths to reach devices.

**5. Beamforming:**

Complementing Massive MIMO is Beamforming, a technique that focuses radio signals directly towards individual devices. By concentrating signal energy in specific directions, beamforming enhances signal strength, reduces interference, and improves overall network efficiency.

5G implementations utilize advanced beamforming techniques, including 3D beamforming, to accurately target users in both horizontal and vertical domains. This is particularly important for dense urban environments with users spread across different floors of buildings.

**6. Small Cells:**

Due to the limited range of high-frequency signals, particularly in the mmWave spectrum, 5G deployments rely heavily on small cells. These are low-power, compact base stations strategically placed to enhance coverage and capacity in densely populated areas.

Small cells, combined with Massive MIMO and beamforming, play a crucial role in ensuring seamless connectivity in urban environments where mmWave frequencies are deployed. They effectively mitigate the challenges posed by signal attenuation and penetration issues associated with higher frequencies.

**7. Network Slicing:**

To address the diverse requirements of different 5G applications, network slicing emerges as a key technology. Network slicing allows operators to create virtualized, independent networks on top of a shared physical infrastructure.

Each network slice can be tailored to meet the specific needs of a particular service or application, such as low latency for autonomous vehicles or high bandwidth for video streaming. This allows operators to optimize network resources, ensuring efficient service delivery and supporting a wide range of use cases.

These technologies work in synergy to deliver the enhanced performance, flexibility, and scalability that define 5G wireless communication. They enable a wide range of applications, from enhanced mobile broadband to mission-critical communications and massive IoT connectivity, paving the way for transformative advancements in various industries.




## Concerns Surrounding 5G

*   **Interference Issues:**
    *   The spectrum used by some 5G implementations is close to that used by passive remote sensing, such as by weather and Earth observation satellites, especially for water vapor monitoring. This interference can be significant without effective controls.
    *   There has already been increased interference with some other previous uses of the near band. 
    *   Interference in satellite operations impairs numerical weather forecasting, which can negatively impact commercial aviation and public safety. 
    *   At the 2019 World Radiocommunication Conference, atmospheric scientists advocated for a  strong −55 decibels watts (dBW) restriction. European regulators agreed to a recommendation of −42 dBW, and US regulators recommended a −20 dBW restriction.
    *   The ITU decided on an intermediate −33 dBW until September 1, 2027, and then a standard −39 dBW. 
    *   The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) warned that the ITU standard, which is 10 times less stringent than the WMO recommendation, could "significantly degrade the accuracy of the data collected."
    *   The American Meteorological Society (AMS) also warned of interference, and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) said that society risks "history repeating itself" by ignoring the warnings of atmospheric scientists (referring to global warming, whose monitoring could be endangered).
      
*   **Surveillance Concerns:**
    *   Due to fear of possible espionage of foreign users by Chinese equipment vendors, several countries have restricted or eliminated using Chinese equipment on their 5G networks.
    *   The 5G security architecture is being adjusted to allow as much metadata collection as possible for mass surveillance.
      
*   **Health Concerns:**
    *   There are concerns that 5G radiation could have adverse health effects.
    *   The Physics department at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem described how human sweat ducts act like helical antennas when exposed to 5G wavelengths, which could lead to health effects.
    *   While electromagnetic hypersensitivity is not scientifically recognized, some people have reported symptoms such as headache and tiredness as a result of exposure to electromagnetic fields such as those from 5G and Wi-Fi.
    *   5G technology presents some new challenges, including higher microwave frequencies (2.6 GHz to 28 GHz) than 4G (700–2500 MHz).
    *   Because the highest millimeter wave used in 5G doesn't easily penetrate objects, antennas must be installed every few hundred meters, which has caused public concern.
      
*   **Security Concerns:**
    *   Researchers from ETH Zurich, the University of Lorraine, and the University of Dundee published a paper entitled, "A formal analysis of 5G authentication,” which raises security concerns.
    *   IoT Analytics estimates that the number of IoT devices, enabled by 5G, will increase from 7 billion in 2018 to 21.5 billion in 2025.
    *   The increased use of IoT devices enabled by 5G could increase the potential for DDoS attacks, crypto jacking, and other cyber attacks.


*   **Complexity:** 5G networks are complex, incorporating multiple services, standards, and site types. They will need to support the coexistence of multiple standards, such as 5G, LTE, and Wi-Fi, and coordinate different site types, such as macro, micro, and pico base stations. This creates a challenge in designing a flexible network architecture that can meet these demands.
  
*   **Cost:** The need to increase the number of gateway nodes by a factor of 20 to 30 times the original amount will significantly increase the cost for operators if they use existing gateway architecture. Developing the infrastructure needed to support 5G is expensive. Older devices may not be compatible with 5G and may need to be replaced.



## Applications of 5G Wireless Communication Systems


*   **Smart Home:**  5G will enhance smart home capabilities, allowing more reliable and user-friendly connections between devices with different performance requirements. 5G is expected to improve upon existing smart home technology by providing more reliable connections between a wide range of devices. Currently, smart homes use various wireless technologies, including WLAN, Bluetooth Low Energy, Zigbee, and Z-Wave. 5G is expected to enhance these existing technologies.
  
*   **Driverless Automobiles:** 5G will play a vital role in the development of autonomous vehicles (self-driving cars). Enhanced communication between vehicles and infrastructure will contribute to the safety and effectiveness of these vehicles.
  
*   **Cloud Computing:** 5G will enable the delivery of cloud computing services closer to users, reducing latency and potentially making applications that currently require powerful PCs accessible on smaller, less powerful devices.
  
*   **Software as an Applicant:** The speed and capacity of 5G networks will enable "software as an applicant" where software communicates directly with other software, independent of human interaction.


*   **Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR):** AR and VR applications require very high bandwidth and low latency, which 5G networks are expected to provide. A cloud-based server would need to be able to provide at least 5 gigabits per second of bandwidth to a wireless user in order to deliver a realistic sensory experience in real time. The sources suggest that AR and VR workloads might be better suited to small cell implementations because of the large amount of processing power these applications require.

*   **Wireline Convergence:** One predicted benefit of the shift to 5G is that it will lead to the convergence of multiple networking functions, leading to reduced cost, power consumption, and complexity. This convergence could involve combining cellular and Wi-Fi channels or utilizing a single silicon chip for various radio access technologies. The sources note that 5G could make it possible to phase out wireline infrastructure, including circuit-switched networks and traditional telephone lines.

*   **Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Communications:** 5G will enable low-latency communication between vehicles and cloud data centers, making it possible to run much of the software for vehicles, such as control and maintenance programs, remotely from fixed data centers. This could result in safer transportation systems. The sources suggest that this technology will build on the C-V2X communication technology, which is already being implemented in 4G networks and enables communication between vehicles and between vehicles and infrastructure. C-V2X will likely be further developed in 5G.

*   **Internet of Things:** 5G will be able to support massive numbers of connected devices, making it possible to connect many "smart" devices that currently rely on smartphone-level computing power to edge computing systems. In a 5G network, many devices could get instructions from a nearby edge computing system rather than having their own internal computing power. This would make these devices, including appliances, climate controls, and health monitors, easier to produce and control. The sources also suggest that 5G could make it possible for 5G transmitters in neighborhoods to act as service centers for the Internet of Things, replacing the IoT hubs that are currently being produced by some companies. The role of the 5G network would be similar to the role played by Wi-Fi routers today. In addition, machine-to-machine (M2M) communication will be enabled by 5G, allowing devices like manufacturing robots to coordinate with each other, potentially guided by an M2M hub at the 5G base station.

*   **Satellite Access:** 5G could be used to deliver satellite transmission to fill in coverage gaps in remote or neglected areas.
