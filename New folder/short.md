### 1. **Define speed and latency of 5G**
   - **Speed**: 5G provides peak data rates of up to 10 Gbps or higher, significantly faster than 4G LTE.
   - **Latency**: The end-to-end latency in 5G is as low as 1 millisecond (ms), enabling near real-time communications.

### 2. **Specifications of 5G**
   - Peak data rate: Up to 10 Gbps.
   - Latency: Less than 1 ms.
   - Connection density: Supports up to 1 million devices per square kilometer.
   - Spectrum efficiency: 3× better than 4G.
   - Mobility: Supports up to 500 km/h.
   - Frequency bands: Operates in both sub-6 GHz and millimeter-wave (mmWave) spectrums.

### 3. **What is cell clustering?**
   - Cell clustering involves grouping multiple base stations or cells into clusters to improve coordination and management of resources in cellular networks. It is often used for interference reduction and efficient spectrum utilization.

### 4. **Define augmented reality (AR)**
   - AR is a technology that overlays digital content (e.g., images, sounds, or other data) onto the real world, enhancing the user’s perception of their environment.

### 5. **Features and challenges of 5G**
   **Features**:
   - Ultra-high speed.
   - Low latency.
   - Massive connectivity.
   - Enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB).
   - Support for IoT and machine-to-machine (mMTC) communication.

   **Challenges**:
   - High deployment cost.
   - Limited coverage in initial phases.
   - Power consumption.
   - Security vulnerabilities.
   - Spectrum allocation complexities.

### 6. **Purpose of eMBB and mMTC**
   - **eMBB (Enhanced Mobile Broadband)**: Focuses on delivering high-speed internet and supporting applications like UHD video streaming and AR/VR.
   - **mMTC (Massive Machine-Type Communication)**: Aims to support IoT applications by enabling massive device connectivity with low power consumption.


### 9. **Define network slicing in mobile networks**
   - Network slicing involves dividing a physical 5G network into multiple virtual networks, each optimized for specific use cases like IoT, autonomous driving, or broadband services.


### 11. **Define Security Architecture**
   - Security architecture refers to the structured design principles and processes used to protect a network's confidentiality, integrity, and availability, encompassing encryption, authentication, and access control mechanisms.

### 12. **Classify Multiple Access Schemes**
   - **FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access)**
   - **TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access)**
   - **CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)**
   - **OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access)**
   - **NOMA (Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access)** used in 5G for better spectral efficiency.

### 13. **Sketch CP Design in 5G NR**
   - CP (Cyclic Prefix) is a guard interval used in OFDM systems to prevent inter-symbol interference (ISI). In 5G NR, CP design involves flexible subcarrier spacing and guard intervals. *(Sketch would require a graphical representation.)*

### 14. **Describe Logical Channels for NR**
   - Logical channels in 5G NR are categorized as:
     - **Control Channels**: Used for signaling information (e.g., BCCH, CCCH).
     - **Traffic Channels**: Carry user data (e.g., DTCH, MTCH).

### 15. **State the Channel Mapping**
   - Logical channels map to transport channels, which in turn map to physical channels. For example:
     - **Logical channel**: DTCH → **Transport channel**: DL-SCH → **Physical channel**: PDSCH.

### 16. **Define Radio Access Network (RAN)**
   - RAN is the part of a mobile network that connects user devices to the core network, typically consisting of base stations (gNB in 5G) and antennas.

### 17. **State the Cyclic Prefix OFDM**
   - Cyclic Prefix OFDM is a type of OFDM that includes a cyclic prefix (a repetition of the end of the symbol) to eliminate ISI and maintain orthogonality between subcarriers.


### 18. **Define Channel Hierarchy**
   - Channel hierarchy in 5G organizes channels into:
     - **Logical Channels**: High-level abstraction for data (e.g., control, traffic).
     - **Transport Channels**: Data transmission methods.
     - **Physical Channels**: Implementation of signals over the air interface.
