

## History of Automation


**The 1990s witnessed the use of automation for User Interface (UI) testing.** This involved testing the visual elements of interfaces to ensure proper functionality for users. The shift from corporate computer use to individual users prompted the creation of Quality Assurance (QA) automation scripts.

**The 2000s saw the adoption of automation in the banking and insurance sectors.** Screen scraping technology, automating data extraction from applications, played a significant role in this adoption. These sectors were early adopters due to their data-heavy processes and available resources. However, automation at this time still had a high entry barrier, requiring significant IT infrastructure, specialized engineering skills, and time-consuming integrations.

**Around 2012, large businesses officially recognized RPA technology.** This was driven by the need to reduce expenses after the financial crisis and a growing understanding of the importance of digital transformation. RPA offered a relatively affordable solution for businesses to go digital.



## RPA Control Flow Architecture

**RPA control flow architecture defines the sequence and execution of tasks performed by an RPA bot to automate a process.** It determines how the bot interacts with systems, applications, and data to achieve the desired outcome.

**The following components typically comprise RPA control flow architecture**:

*   **Start:** Triggered by events, scheduled times, or manual initiation.
*   **Input:** Data and instructions are received for process execution. This may include user inputs, files, or data from external systems.
*   **Control Logic:** Defines the bot's decision-making process through conditional statements, loops, and branches, which determine the action sequence based on predefined rules or conditions.
*   **Interaction:** The bot interacts with systems and applications through UI automation, API calls, database queries, or other integration methods to perform actions like data entry, retrieval, navigation, and manipulation.
*   **Data Manipulation:**  The bot processes data as per the automation process, including extraction, transformation, validation, and calculations.
*   **Error Handling:**  Mechanisms are implemented to handle exceptions, recover from errors, and log error information for troubleshooting to ensure smooth automation even in unexpected scenarios.
*   **Output:** The bot generates output data or performs actions like generating reports, updating databases, or sending notifications upon completing automation tasks.
*   **End:**  The process concludes or awaits the next trigger based on automation needs.



## RPA Center of Excellence (CoE)

A **RPA CoE** acts as a central hub for governing and managing RPA initiatives within an organization. Think of it as a specialized team with a structured framework to champion RPA adoption. This team's objective is to ensure RPA is implemented effectively and strategically across the organization. 

**Key functions of an RPA CoE include**:

* **Identifying Automation Opportunities**: Working with different departments to pinpoint processes suitable for RPA.
* **Developing Standards**: Establishing best practices for RPA development, implementation, and maintenance across the organization.
* **Building Expertise**: Providing training and support to teams adopting RPA.
* **Selecting Tools**: Evaluating and choosing the right RPA tools and infrastructure based on the organization's specific needs.
* **Monitoring Performance**: Tracking the effectiveness of RPA initiatives and measuring their impact on key business metrics.
* **Governance**: Establishing clear roles, responsibilities, and procedures for managing RPA projects to ensure compliance and security. 

## RPA Implementation Methodologies


*   **Waterfall Methodology**: This is a traditional, linear approach to software development. Each phase (requirements, design, development, testing, deployment) is completed before moving to the next. While this method can be adapted for RPA, it's less flexible than Agile methodologies.
*   **Agile Methodology**: This iterative approach emphasizes collaboration, adaptability, and continuous improvement. The project is divided into smaller "sprints" that deliver usable functionality. Stakeholder feedback is crucial for making adjustments throughout the process.  Agile methods like Scrum or Kanban can be used for RPA.
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC)**: This approach focuses on quickly validating the feasibility and effectiveness of an RPA solution on a small scale. A specific process or use case is automated to assess potential benefits, ROI, and technical feasibility before full-scale implementation.
*   **Center of Excellence (CoE)**: As discussed in our previous conversation, a CoE is a dedicated team within the organization responsible for driving RPA initiatives. The CoE acts as a central hub for RPA knowledge, governance, and support, guiding successful implementation and management of RPA projects.
*   **Hybrid Methodology**: This approach combines elements of different methodologies to suit specific organizational needs. For example, Agile might be used for development and implementation, while the CoE model might be used for governance and support.

RDLC (Robotic Process Automation Development Life Cycle) is a structured framework that guides organizations through the process of implementing and managing RPA solutions.  It outlines the steps involved in developing, testing, and deploying RPA bots to ensure successful automation.  **The typical RDLC consists of six phases:**

1. **Identify:** Identify potential business processes suitable for automation. Consider factors like rule-based nature, data structure, and potential ROI.
2. **Analyze:** Deeply analyze the selected processes to understand their complexities, dependencies, and potential challenges.
3. **Design:** Create a detailed Process Definition Document (PDD) outlining the automation workflow, including steps, inputs, outputs, and dependencies.  Visualize the process using flowcharts.
4. **Develop:** Develop automation scripts and code using appropriate RPA tools based on the design specifications.
5. **Test:** Rigorously test the developed bot to ensure it meets all requirements and performs as expected.
