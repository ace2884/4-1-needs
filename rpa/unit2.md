

 **Robotic Process Automation (RPA)** is a technology that uses software robots, or "bots," to automate repetitive, rule-based tasks that were previously done by humans. These bots can interact with various applications, systems, and user interfaces just like human operators would, allowing them to complete end-to-end processes.
The use of RPA is not limited to large enterprises; smaller businesses (SMBs) are increasingly adopting RPA for mission-critical tasks, taking advantage of the RPA-as-a-Service model. This shift is making RPA more accessible to a wider range of businesses, leading to its "democratization".
RPA, however, is evolving beyond simply automating tasks and is becoming part of a larger, interconnected ecosystem that includes other technologies and practices

## Environment Setup for RPA Implementation

Setting up the proper environment for RPA implementation is crucial for success. This involves creating distinct environments for development, testing, and production, each with its own set of servers, workstations, and access controls. Here are some key considerations for infrastructure setup:

*   **Licensing**: Ensure the organization has the necessary licenses for the chosen RPA tool across all environments (development, test, and production). Each vendor has different licensing terms, so carefully review and acquire the appropriate licenses.
*   **Virtual Environment Support**:  Determine if the RPA tool supports virtual machines (VMs) and cloud environments. Most organizations use VMs or cloud infrastructure, so verifying compatibility is essential.
*   **Application Access on Servers**: Test application functionality on VM servers. Some applications may not be compatible or may have restrictions that could impact RPA functionality.
*   **Security Policies**:  Understand the security policies for desktops and VMs, ensuring they do not interfere with the RPA tool or application functionality.
*   **Software Update Policies**:  Involve the RPA team in discussions about software update policies. Software updates can sometimes cause issues with RPA automation. These updates should be tested in lower-level environments before being implemented in production.
*   **Access Restrictions**:  Implement strict access restrictions for higher-level environments, such as production, based on business needs and organizational policies. Access should be granted only to authorized personnel.
*   **Supporting Tool Access**: Ensure supporting tools like OCR, Microsoft Office, and email clients adhere to the same infrastructure setup as RPA. These tools are often integrated with RPA solutions, so consistent access is crucial.
*   **Application Server Versions**:  Verify that the versions of applications used in development and testing match the versions on the production servers. Discrepancies in versions can lead to unexpected behavior.
*   **Active Directory (AD) Groups**:  Organize access requests using AD groups whenever possible. Create separate groups for different user roles and grant access accordingly. This simplifies access management and improves security.
